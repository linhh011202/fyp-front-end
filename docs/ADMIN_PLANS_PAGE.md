## Component Architecture

### CreatePlansView

Main component that handles the entire plans management interface.

**State Management**:
```typescript
const [plans, setPlans] = useState<PlanFormData[]>([]);          // List of plans
const [currentPlan, setCurrentPlan] = useState<PlanFormData>(); // Plan being edited
const [featureInput, setFeatureInput] = useState('');            // Feature input field
const [dialogOpen, setDialogOpen] = useState(false);             // Dialog visibility
const [editIndex, setEditIndex] = useState<number | null>(null); // Editing index
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);                   // API loading state
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);         // Error messages
const [success, setSuccess] = useState<string | null>(null);     // Success messages
```

**Key Functions**:

#### `handleAddPlan()`
Opens the dialog to create a new plan.

#### `handleEditPlan(index)`
Opens the dialog with the selected plan's data for editing.

#### `handleDeletePlan(index)`
Removes a plan from the list.

#### `handleSavePlan()`
Validates and saves the current plan (add or update).

**Validation includes**:
- Plan ID uniqueness
- Required fields (ID, name, price, priceId)
- At least one feature

#### `handleAddFeature()`
Adds a new feature to the current plan's feature list.

#### `handleRemoveFeature(index)`
Removes a feature from the current plan.

#### `handleSubmitPlans()`
Publishes all plans to the backend API.

**Process**:
1. Validates there's at least one plan
2. Gets the access token
3. Converts plans to API format
4. Calls `plansService.createPlans()`
5. Shows success/error message
6. Clears plans on success

## API Integration

}
```

### Error Handling

## Usage Example

### Creating Plans

1. Navigate to `/admin/plans`
2. Click "Add Plan"
3. Fill in plan details:
   ```
   Plan ID: basic-plan-2025
   Plan Name: Basic
   Price: $10/month
   Stripe Price ID: price_1SHpG27ulmHU5ctwMzG3Id2C
   ```
4. Add features:
   - Type "10 GB Storage" and press Enter
   - Type "Email Support" and press Enter
   - Type "Monthly Billing" and press Enter
5. Click "Add"
6. Repeat for other plans
7. Click "Publish Plans"

### Editing Plans

1. Find the plan card you want to edit
2. Click the "Edit" button
3. Modify any field except Plan ID
4. Add or remove features
5. Click "Update"
6. Click "Publish Plans" to apply changes

### Recommended Plan

Only mark one plan as recommended:
1. When creating/editing a plan
2. Check "Mark as recommended"
3. Uncheck this for other plans
4. The recommended plan will have:
   - Blue border
   - "RECOMMENDED" badge
   - Higher visual prominence

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Required
The page fetches the access token from localStorage:
```typescript
const token = authService.getAccessToken();
```

### Admin Authorization
The backend validates:
- Token is valid
- User has admin role
- User's email is verified

### Token Refresh
If the token expires during the session, the user needs to:
1. Log out
2. Log back in with admin credentials
3. Retry the operation

## Best Practices

### Plan IDs
- Use consistent naming: `{tier}-plan-{version}`
- Examples: `basic-plan-001`, `premium-plan-2025`
- Helps track plan evolution across versions

### Pricing Display
- Include billing period: `$10/month`, `$100/year`
- Be clear about currency
- Use consistent formatting

### Features
- Be specific and measurable
- Start with most important features
- Use 3-7 features per plan
- Keep descriptions concise

### Stripe Price IDs
- Create prices in Stripe first
- Use test mode price IDs for testing
- Use production price IDs for live plans
- Double-check before publishing

## Validation Rules

### Plan ID
- Required
- Must be unique in the current list
- Cannot be changed after saving to list
- Alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores

### Plan Name
- Required
- Display name for users
- Should be short and memorable

### Price
- Required
- String format (allows flexible formatting)
- Include currency and period

### Stripe Price ID
- Required
- Must match format: `price_*`
- Must exist in your Stripe account

### Features
- At least one required
- Each feature is a string
- Displayed with checkmark icons

### Recommended
- Optional boolean
- Best practice: Only one plan recommended

## Troubleshooting

### "Access denied. You must be an admin to create plans."
**Solution**: Verify your account has admin role in the backend database.

### "Unauthorized. Please log in again."
**Solution**: Your token has expired. Log out and log back in.

### "Plan ID already exists"
**Solution**: Choose a different unique ID for the plan.

### "At least one feature is required"
**Solution**: Add at least one feature to the plan before saving.

### Plans not appearing after publish
**Solution**: 
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the API response in Network tab
3. Navigate to `/subscription` to see if plans appear

### Stripe checkout not working
**Solution**: 
1. Verify Stripe Price IDs are correct
2. Check Stripe dashboard for price status
3. Ensure prices are active, not archived

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a plan with all required fields
- [ ] Create a plan with recommended flag
- [ ] Edit an existing plan

- [ ] Publish plans successfully
- [ ] Verify plans appear on `/subscription` page
- [ ] Test with non-admin account (should fail)
- [ ] Test with expired token (should prompt login)

### Testing with Different Scenarios

1. **Empty Start**: Begin with no plans, add first one
2. **Multiple Plans**: Create 3-5 plans with various features
3. **Recommended Plan**: Mark one plan as recommended
4. **Edit After Create**: Create, then immediately edit
5. **Delete and Recreate**: Delete a plan and add it back
6. **Long Feature Lists**: Add 10+ features to one plan
